**1    Preliminary Investigation**

**Description of System**

- Online movie ticket booking is a faster, cleaner and a tad more personal website, specially designed to make your booking experience better.
- Log on, navigate and find out for yourselves and if time permits leave your valuable feedback.
- Customers may view the contents of any movie show at any time and may book any movie ticket as needed.
- The program automatically calculates the subtotal and grand total.
- When a visitor decides to finally book the ticket, the order information including the buyer&#39;s name, address and billing instruction is stored in the database securely and payment has been made.
- You need to register a new user whenever you have first visited our site then for future it will be stored in our database permanently and you can book you movie ticket at any time you want with this username and password.









**Limitations of present system**



- In the existing system, a person has to visit cinema hall for booking movie tickets, the user may know about the movie being played in the cinema from the newspapers but the cache is that the person may not know whether the cinema hall is completely booked or not.
- Another problem is that the rates are not constant across all cinema hall, different halls may have different rates of the ticket.
- Even the customer may not be able to get information about different cinema hall available in the city or even close to his vicinity.
- So, if the person wishes to see a movie on a particular day he will have a hard time finding out which show is being shown at the specific time. Further cinema hall owner has to hire large number of staff at the counter for selling tickets.
- Hence this system is much tedious to handle and not much user friendly as per the need of current scenario.

















**Proposed system and its advantages**



- The system is an Online Movie Ticket Booking System developed for accessing theaters across all over India.
- It is a concept of developing a web portal where a person can book tickets made available in the site.
- In order to overcome the existing problem we are making this system as online where information about any cinema hall, movie, theater and rates can get online which helps the customer to get better facilities at his own computer or laptop.



**Advantages**

A person should be able to

· Choose city where he/she want to see the Movie.

. Search for movie information available in the site.

· Choose the movie which he/she wishes to book tickets.

. Search for movies available close to his vicinity.

· Able to choose the seats which are available for a certain class.

· Can select seats from different classes as well for same show and screen also.







**Feasibility Study**

                  This project on Online Movie Ticket Booking is highly feasible.

**Economic Feasibility:**

- It does not have much development cost, because it is a small scale project.

- The admin doesn&#39;t require a license to use the website and so it is economical.

- Being an individually developed project it has no expense of salary to employees.

- Since this is a website so it doesn&#39;t require any staff to operate on it. And any updating can be managed by the admin. So it doesn&#39;t have salary problem.

**Technological Feasibility:**

- Being a small scale project, the working of the website is quietly simple.

- The website is user friendly and so this new technology will save a lot  of time, of both the user and admin.

- **HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:**

 The hardware requirements for development of the system are:

              1. Minimum PC – P IV with 160 GB HDD and 2 GB RAM.

              2. Windows XP, Windows 7 and after this.

- **TOOLS**** USED ****AND DESCRIPTION**

**Front Ends: - Microsoft** ASP.NET

**Back Ends: -** SQL Server Management Studio 2008

**Reasons for Tool Selected: -** Easy to handle, User friendly

**Organizational Feasibility:**

- Since the organization didn&#39;t have a website earlier and the working of the website is easy there won&#39;t be any confusion as to work with the website.

**Stake holder**

1. 1)
2. 2)
3. 3)

**Visitor:** - Visitor can browse through the contents of the website, can get information about the movies. Visitor will have to register to be a member.

**Member:** - Member logs in to the website. They can book the tickets, find theater that are near to them, buy some additional stuff like food items, avoiding long queues at the food stalls formed during the intervals. Members can also provide their feedback about the site.

**Admin:** - The admins job is to manage the website. An admin can view all the new registrations and verify them or delete them. Admin can add update delete movie content. The admin can also view or delete the query given by the member or visitor and can also reply and delete them. The admin can also view or delete feedback given by the member

**2    System Analysis**

**Introduction**

Analysis is the focus of system developing and is the stage when system designers have to work at two levels of definition regarding the study of situational issues and possible solutions in terms of &quot;what to do&quot; and &quot;how to do&quot;.

**System Study**

**   **  ** DEFINITION OF THE SYSTEM:**

A system is an orderly grouping of independent components linked together   according to a plan to achieve a specific objective. Its main characteristics are organization, interaction, independent, integration and central objective a system does not  necessarily mean to a computer system. It may be a manual system or any other names.

# _     _NEEDS OF THE SYSTEM

- Social and economic factor: a wave of social and economic changes often follows in the wake of the new technology. New opportunities may arise to improve on a production process or to do something that was not previously possible. Changes in the ways individuals are organized into groups may then be necessary, and the new groups may complete for economic resources with established units.
- Technological factor: people have never before in a time when the scope of scientific inquiry was so broad, so when the speed of applying the new technology accounts for many changes in the organization.
- High level decisions and operating processes: in response to technological, socio-economical factors, top level managers may decide to recognize operations and introduce new products.

                To deal with these needs, people commonly seek new modified information to support the decision. When that happens, then they obtain turn to a computer system for help the information users and data processing specialist then work together to complete a series of steps in a system study to produce output results to satisfy information needs.

**System analysis**

       System Analysis is a process by which we attribute process or goals to a human activity, determine how well those purpose are being achieved and specify the requirements of the various tools and techniques that are to be used within the system if the system performances are to be achieved.

**1. SYSTEM PLANNING**

Planning for information systems has a time horizon and a focus dimension. The time horizon dimension specifies the time range of the plan, where as the focus dimension relates whether the primary concern is strategic, managerial, or operational. The system i.e. The Project that we were assigned was required to complete within 20 weeks. What we had planned is as follows:

 Requirements analysis, Preliminary Investigation &amp; Information Gathering should be covered within the 1st and 2nd week. It took 12 Weeks for the design of the system under development. 1 week for Testing &amp; Implementation. And rest 2 reserve weeks.

**2.**** PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION**

**T** he initial investigation has the objective of determining the validity of the user&#39;s request for a candidate system and whether a feasibility study should be conducted.

 The objectives of the problem posed by the user must be understood within the framework of the organization&#39;s MIS plan. **I** had investigated from the concerned authority about the project



**3. INFORMATION GATHERING**

          Akey part of feasibility analysis is gathering information about the present system. The analyst must know what information to gather, where to find it, how to collect it, and what to make of it. The proper use of tools for gathering information is the key to successful analysis. The tools are the traditional interview, questionnaires, and on-site observation.



**4. STRUCTURED ANALYSIS**

             The traditional tools of data gathering have limitations. An English narrative description is often vague and difficult for the user to grasp. System flowcharts focus more on physical than on logical implementation of the candidate system. Because of these drawbacks, structured tools were introduced for analysis. Structured analysis is a set of techniques and graphical tools (DFD) that allow the analyst to develop a new kind of system specifications that are easily understandable to the user.

**Validations**

While creating the software it was assured that validations are proper for each and every field so that it will help the user to fill in the proper input in the field so that he will not make a mistake. Some validations, which are set, are as follows:

- If the user enters any wrong input, a particular field will not allow that input or it will flash an error.
- If user enters higher value in weight or calf, then the text will be cleared and the user will be asked to enter the value again.

**Testing**

Testing is the major quality measure employed during software development. Its basic function is to detect errors in the software. During requirements analysis and design, the output is a document that is usually textual and non-executable. After the coding phase, computer programs are available that can be executed for testing purpose. Thus the goal of testing is to uncover requirement, design or coding errors in the programs. Consequently, different levels of testing are employed.

The starting point of testing was unit testing in which a module was tested separately by us. The purpose was to exercise the different parts of the module code to detect coding errors. After this the module were gradually integrated into subsystems, which were then integrated themselves to form entire system. During integration of modules, integration testing was performed. The goal of this testing was to detect design errors, while focusing on testing the interconnection between modules. After the system was put together, system testing was performed. Here the system was tested against the system requirements to see if all the requirements were met and the system performed as specified by the requirements. Finally the acceptance testing to demonstrate to the client which is to be done.

The final output of the testing phase was the test report and error report which was supposed to referred by us to remove the errors encountered during testing, but the final results were not known to us till the time of this documentation as the software was gone to testing department for client side testing, the company provided us the following documentation to be included in the project report for testing part.

# **5    SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION**

Any website consists of mostly web page files and images. The process used to upload the files from a desktop PC to a web server space is called FTP (File Transfer Protocol).

Essentially this is the opposite process from downloading files from the internet. The download process is all handled automatically by the web browsing software.

Before uploading anything one must find way to the hosting space. After signing up with the hosting company they provide information on how to upload web pages. The company provides with the details of the location of our space, a user ID and a password.

To actually upload the file one need to have an \*\*FTP Client\*. This is a software application designed to facilitate the \*FTP\* process.

Within the FTP client one can set up the connection with the required information (the user ID and login from the hosting company).When this is set up for the site then drag and drop the files between folders on your PC using IE. The   FTP client saves the details making it easier to do this on subsequent occasions.

When your site has been uploaded it can be accessed immediately via the internet by entering the domain name into the address bar.

1. 1)Decide where you are going to put your pages.
2. 2)Find out the details of your account: your username, your password, the &quot; host name &quot;(the machine where you upload your files) , and your URL or web address.
3. 3)Connect to the Internet.
4. 4)Open up an FTP program (like Fetch-Mac or WS-FTP-PC).
5. 5)Put in the hostname of your website.
6. 6)Put in your username.
7. 7)Put in your password.
8. 8)Connect to the site.
9. 9)Highlights the files you would like on your website.

# **6    Future Enhancements**

# In future the website will be developed more by adding more details to it, more functionality to it.

- A Forum will be created where users can discuss about the movies or can hold conversations of posted messages.

- Enhanced Security Features will be provide.

- Google maps will be incorporated to provide accurate locations of cinemas.
